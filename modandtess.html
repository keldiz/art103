  <h3>Phase 1</h3>

  <p>FIRST PASS: Exercise in Testing Some Origami Modules and 2D Tesselations</p>

  <br></br>

  <p>Artist Statement</p>


  <p>Iâ€™ve done origami before, but this was the first time that I tried to do a modular piece.
    <br>I followed a video tutorial called Petra Star. The star consists of 8 modular pieces that, if rearranged,
    <br>can be used to create a different shape as shown
    on the second image.

    <p>
      For the tessellations assignment, I used simple geometrical shapes and drew them on paper.
      <br> It took me a couple of tries of drawing and cutting until I finally made my cutouts tessellate.
      <br>As a person who enjoys playing puzzles, drawing pieces trying to make them fit together was a very exciting process for me.
      <br> This project makes me want to make a Ravensburger puzzle which is an all black, no image puzzle.
      <br>However, making this puzzle and having your pieces tessellatee will probably make it more challenging. </p>

  <p>SECOND PASS: A group exercise with Tesslation and Modularity with some 2D shapes</p>
  <br></br>
  <p>Artist Statement</p>

  <p>For the second phase, our group collaborated to create a tessellation using our own unique design.
    <br> We started with a standard piece and each person in our group added a design to the standard piece.
    <br>We inverted the shape of our standard piece which allowed us to connect our designs together.
    <br> To make our pieces fit, two people in our group used two designs that match their parts,
    <br>while the other two used the remaining designs which allowed all our pieces to tessellate.
    <br> Having knowledge in Adobe Illustrator made this project more enjoyable because I was able to play
    <br> around with organic shapes using the pen tool. I had fun working with my group because we were able
    <br> to put our heads together as we brainstormed about the patterns and made sure that our designs fit together. </p>

  <h3> Phase 2 -- 3D Fastener Brainstorming Designs, Mockups and Design Approaches </h3>
  <br></br>

  <p>Artist Statement</p>
  <<<<<<< HEAD <p>For my first sample, I used a slot/notch fastener. The first piece is inserted inside a cardboard the I inserted two similarly cut pieces inside the first piece. <br>This allowed the fit to be very snug, without locking the joints.

    <p>I wanted to make my own design for this project. I cut pieces of cardboards and taped them together to make it look like a key. <br>I then cut a hole to fit the key, and I made a round cut that lets me turn the key at a 45 degree angle. <br>
      Lastly, I cut a third piece that is deasigned to hold the two pieces together, without locking them. </p>

    <h3>Phase 3: Test Cuts</h3>

    <br></br>

    <p>Our theme for this group project is about the role of bees in our society. Our test cuts included shape of bees, hives, bees on a flower, and a three slot joinery. <br>
      Our initial cut went as expected--we saw areas where we can improve on. For example, the fasteners were a little bit off and needed to be adjusted in Adobe illustrator. The bee shapes looked nice; however, some parts were too thin and broke
      easily. <br>
      Overall, the first test cut was very productive and gave us more ideas for our next and final cuts </p>

  <br></br>
  <p>This group project took a lof of research and brainstormng from every member. Our decision to make our theme about the role of bees in our environment made this process very exciting. <br>
    We researched different topics which will help us later in designing our pieces. We designed six </p>
