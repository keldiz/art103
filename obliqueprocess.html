  <p>Student Works: Unity and Blender</p>

<p>Artist Statement
  <br>This is one of my favorite projects because I've never used a 3D modeling software or Unity until last year.
<br>After taking two Art courses that introduced 3D and game designs, I developed an interest in creating assets.
<br>I am proud of this work because I worked with a group on this game. We faced many challenges.
<br>Working with a group of students is always challenging because we have differnet workloads
<br>and more often than not, we are behind on schedule. However, for this project we decided that
<br>we're gonna give it our best and produce the best game we've ever made. The project was very successful
<br> and we surprised a lot of students including our professor.
